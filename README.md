HcdsbWeatherTicker
==================

Written in 2010. A swing desktop application that parses weather data from Weather Underground and outputs it without additional information, meant as a base for others to modify into an effective weather ticker. This application relies on XOM in order to parse XML data provided by WUnderground.

This is by no means a ready-to-ship product and additional work needs to be done to make output more "friendly", this served as an exploration of the use of web APIs, and upon the request of someone who wished to have base to write a weather ticker to be displayed in Holy Trinity Catholic Secondary School.
